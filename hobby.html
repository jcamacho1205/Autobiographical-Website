		<h1>Aquarium Hobby</h1>
		
		<p>I've kept fish for most of my life. However, only recently, in june of 2017, did I start understanding and loving the hobby.</p>
		<p>I've had ups and downs; I'm still learning and improving things. Here's some of my fish tanks :)</p>
		
		<h2>My 60 gallon planted aquarium</h2>
		<img src="60_gal.gif" width = "780" height = "416" 
		alt = "A picture of my 60 gallon aquarium"/>
		<p>This was my second aquarium ever. It was a great, yet expensive, learning experience jeje.</p>
		
		<h2>My 20 gallon planted aquarium</h2>
		<img src="20_gal.gif" width = "806" height = "604" 
		alt = "A picture of my 20 gallon aquarium"/>
		<p>This was my fourth aquarium ever. It was the first time I did a "high-tech" fish tank.</p>
		<p>It's called a high-tech aquarium because it has high lighting, nutrient-rich substrate, and supplement carbon dioxide(or CO2).</p><br />

		<em>"A layout that is crafted with overly great finesse is tiring to look at, 
		and it is also difficult to maintain over a long period of time...<br />
		It is important to provide an unpretentious, casual atmosphere of water and greenery.<br />
		The very atmosphere creates the harmony between the surrounding space and the aquarium."</em><br />
