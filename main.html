		<p>My name is Jonathan Camacho Ortega.</p>
		<p>I am a Computer Science student at the Polytechnic University. My ID is 117820.</p>
		<p>I elected this course because I really 
		enjoy expressing myself creatively with my programming 
		and I've enjoyed learning a bit of Web Development.</p>
		<p>I hoped this course could help me learn the field more 
		in-depth and give me an opportunity to practice as I learn.</p><br />
		<!--<p>We'll see what I can create in these three months. :)</p>-->
		
		<div class = "note"> Note: By clicking the icons next to the homepage icon, 
		you can see only two examples of other hobbies that I like(besides programming), 
		that allow me to express my creativity.</div>
