		<h1>Pixel Art</h1>
		
		<p>I have not been indulging in pixel art for long. I've been interested before the quarantine; however, now that I have time to learn, I gave it a try.</p>
		<p>My interest has roots in the fact that I love retro/indie games.</p> 
		<p>Looking at a pattern of very similar art styles in the play store games that have caught my eye,</p>
		<p>I decided to learn how to draw pixel art if I ever wanted to develop a game for fun.</p>
		
		<h2>Yukon character concept animation</h2>
		<p>I thought about making a game based on the Alaskan Yukon.</p>
		<h3>Clay & his Wood Bison</h3>
		<h4>Bison idle animation</h4>
		<img src = "Bison_idle.gif" width = "256" height = "256"
		alt = "Idle animation of Boy riding a Wood Bison"/>
		<p>This is the Wood Bison's idle animation, while Clay is riding him.</p>
		
		<h4>Bison run animation</h4>
		<img src = "Bison_running.gif" width = "256" height = "256"
		alt = "Run animation of the Wood Bison"/>
		<p>This is the unfinished prototype of the Wood Bison's run animation.</p>
		
		<h4>Boy idle animation</h4>
		<img src = "Boy_idle.gif" width = "256" height = "256"
		alt = "Idle animation of the Boy character"/>
		<p>This is the idle animation of Clay and his possible power sprites. Sorry about it being so blurry; not sure why it is.</p>
		
		<h4>Boy run animation</h4>
		<img src = "Boy_run.gif" width = "256" height = "256"
		alt = "Run animation of the Boy character"/>
		<p>Finally, this is the run animation of Clay.</p>
		
		<p>Honestly, if I ever get to make the game, I'll make the endless runner part first and then move on to designing a story.</p> 
		<p>It's so fun to think about a cool story, but so tedious to bring it to your screen. Hopefully, I'll be able to find the time to do it someday.</p><br />
